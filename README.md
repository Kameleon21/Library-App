# Library-App

## Description

The aim of this project was to learn how objects are stored in arrays and using a basic CRUD system
how you can go about adding deleting and removing items.

Some of the obstacles I had to overcome were how can I re-rerender my DOM and display 
whats inside the array after a user has deleted an object from it 

## Technology used 

- HTML
- CSS
